Getting started

React Box Color

Create a react-app named boxcolor
Start your react application
Clean App.js and App.css file
Update functional component to a class component (App.js)
Set a state (hint: color & clickCounter)
When the button is clicked it should change its color and the counter should increase.
Use a component lifecycle method to call setState.
